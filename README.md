# ToDoList
This was originally a coding task for building a Content Provider in Google Android Dev Challenge by Udacity. 
I developed further this project with SharedPreferences, Notification scheduled by AlarmManager with picking a time 
with TimePickerDialog by the user.

Tags: SQLite, contract class, SQLiteOpenHelper, CursorLoader, ContentProvider, RecyclerView, SharedPreferences, Notification, AlarmManager, TimePickerDialog
