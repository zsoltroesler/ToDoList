# ToDoList
This was originally a coding task for building a Content Provider in Google Android Dev Challenge by Udacity. 
I developed further this project with SharedPreferences, Notification scheduled by AlarmManager with picking a time 
with TimePickerDialog by the user. UPDATE: SQLite database and ContentProvider removed and Android Architecture Components implemented (Room, LiveData, ViewModel, Lifecycle)

Tags: Android Architecture Components (Room, LiveData, ViewModel, Lifecycle), RecyclerView, SharedPreferences, Notification, AlarmManager, TimePickerDialog
